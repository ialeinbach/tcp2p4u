Short-term:
* Actually handle requests that Peer's receive from PeerHandler
* When peer exits, remove corresponding observer

Long-term:
* optimize hashset implementation of message redundancy checking
* design scheme for peer to join existing network
	'--> some sort of handshake to exchange ids?
* design scheme for peer to leave network
	'--> connect adjacent peers together on exit?
* secure messages?
	'--> end to end encryption?
* ability to send messages with specified receivers
	'--> tag system
* logging system?
